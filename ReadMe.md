MJsonViewer

Yet, just another jsonview plugin for Firefox.

###Why I write this plugin.
1. I love Firefox.
2. I find its default jsonviewer is ugly and not directly.

###How it looks like.

###How to install.
Use Firefox to open this [URL:]() or just search in the firefox addon store with keyword: 'MJsonViewer'.

###Thanks
