Yet, just another jsonview plugin for Firefox.

## Why I write this plugin.
1. I love Firefox.
2. I find its default jsonviewer is ugly and not directly.

## How it looks like.
### Its common look.

### If a value-string is a json, when you click the parser will show its structure.

+ or just search in the firefox addon store with keyword: 'MJsonViewer'.


## How to Config
