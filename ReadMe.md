MJsonViewer

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.1-green.svg)](https://github.com/MikeCoder/MJsonViewer)

Yet, just another jsonview plugin for Firefox.

## Why I write this plugin.
1. I love Firefox.
2. I find its default jsonviewer is ugly and not directly.

## How it looks like.
